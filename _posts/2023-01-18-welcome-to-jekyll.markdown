**Let's build some open source apps together!**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - There is a lot of open source code useful for devs etc but we want to build open source apps that end users could deploy and directly use

🌈 Contribution guidelines - As a starting step, we are trying to come up with refined ideas, that the community can pick from and start building

👩‍💻 Useful resources - Get started with the 1000AppIdeas repo and see if you can help us improve those ideas

🍿 Fun facts - We just started on this on Monday, 9th Jan 2023, so it's kind of new

🧙 But you have the power to make the magic work!
